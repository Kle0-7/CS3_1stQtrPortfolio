# Reflection

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

### 1. Markdown
It was easy to do since it was just formatting. Forever love this because it didn't require much thinking.
### 2. Js Operations
-The different kind of operators were really easy to distinguish. With the symbols used, coding' was just pure fun with a little
with it
thinking required. The math operators and the boolean are the favorites *lol*
### 3. Js Variable Declaration.
This reminded me of C++, but the variables
are called differently. It's simple though, and it is  very easy to grasp. I love let!!
### 4. If Else
I love this so much. I have background knowledge on this loop statement from grade 8 so it was just a recap when tackled in class. It's super **duper** simple to understand and read because the syntax is direct as it can be.
### 5. Switch Case 
It's basically just if else but we have
the ability to choose what the outcome is. I love the tv channels for the code.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

### 1. CSS
In general, CSS is just so different from JS and C++. 
It's my first time encountering a different programming language, and I don't really understand it at a deep level.
### 2. Array
I get the overall, syntax, but I don't
know how to apply it in problems. I also had trouble with it because the lessons during grade 8 about it were rushed and didn't really stick.
### 3. Functions 
I don't really understand the syntax itself. I really think I need more examples on how to use it. 
### 4. Nested For loops
I'm not good with for loops to begin with so adding another for loop in that for loop makes it so much more difficult for me to follow. I tried to read it step by step but it just felt so confusing especially the triangle examples.
### 5. HTML
Just like CSS, this is new to me. I didn't really get to focus on it much this quarter, and the tags made me confused on where to put the code or what not to put.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

I think doing practice exercises that include my weaknesses will be the best way to understand them. I will also give more time to do it.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### Effective :
The table discussion really helped in understanding my friends point of view in the topic which broadened my critical thinking.

Open teacher and classmate gave me the chance to ask questions when my table were having trouble understanding a specific part :D

### Not Effective:
For understanding HTML and CSS, the bonus tasks did not really help because I learn better when someone talks through it.

When we have graded activities, especially the last one, I think I'm not able to reach the best understanding due to rushing it or just giving up entirely.
