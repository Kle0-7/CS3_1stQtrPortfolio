# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
### by Kleo Sofya B. Foronda Strontium

1. Expenses covered by PhilHealth
Internet in public schools

2. Inflation on rice 

3. I realized that the country's people had so many problems regarding on how they have to live. It makes me feel more thankful about what I have. This SONA made me feel that it will give hope to those in poverty.

Even though the Philippines has rampant corruption, I think that the president is trying his best to make the Filipinos' lives easier. Especially on how they focused on the youth's schooling. I want to be able to give back to this country as it gave me so many things. I am grateful for my education and quality of life.


4. Development
